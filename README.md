# News Topic Intelligence Service

> üìΩÔ∏è **Demo Video:** [Watch the end-to-end product walk-through](./DEMO_VIDEO.mkv)

> Production-ready FastAPI platform for **multimodal news classification** & summarization with an automated review loop and reproducible ML workflow.

## ‚ö° Spotlight: What I Delivered

- **Built an intelligent RAG chatbot** with multi-source retrieval across 200K+ news articles, platform documentation, and real-time analytics, featuring intent classification, conversation memory, and source citations for comprehensive news intelligence.
- **Hardened the public API** with API-key enforcement, structured logging, latency metrics, and configurable JSON output so analysts and ops teams can trust every response.
- **Built an active learning safety net** that funnels low-confidence predictions into a review queue and promotes human-label feedback back into the training pipeline.
- **Implemented Stream Review system** for real-time human-in-the-loop labeling of streaming data, automatically detecting low-confidence predictions and anomalies during live news processing with dedicated review queues and dashboard integration.
- **Implemented A/B testing infrastructure** for safe model rollouts, comparing ensemble vs transformer performance with traffic splitting, consistent user assignment, and automated winner determination.
- **Automated the model lifecycle** through a Typer CLI that seeds demo data, trains TF-IDF and transformer models, evaluates them, and packages artifacts for S3-compatible storage.
- **Stood up a Streamlit command center** showcasing classifier, summarizer, live trends, and chatbot interface‚Äîperfect for stakeholder demos and recruiter-ready screenshots.
- **Implemented multimodal news classification** using CLIP + BLIP vision models, combining text and image analysis for enhanced accuracy with intelligent confidence scoring.
- **Locked down the supply chain** by upgrading vulnerable dependencies and wiring CI to run Ruff, pytest, Bandit, and pip-audit on every push.

## üîë Design Decisions & Impact

### Active Learning Review Loop

Low-confidence predictions from `/classify_news` (and the batch endpoint) are automatically queued in the database. Reviewers can label them, and the CLI can merge that feedback into future fine-tuning runs‚Äîone tight feedback loop instead of ad-hoc spreadsheets.

### Transparent Operations From Day One

Every request receives an `x-request-id`, metrics are exposed at `/metrics`, and logs are JSON-formatted by default. Turning on `LOG_JSON=0` flips back to console-friendly logs when you just need to prototype.

### Reproducible Training Runs

`scripts/manage.py` is the single entry point for seeding, baseline training, transformer fine-tuning, evaluation, and artifact bundling. Each command supports explicit seeds, dataset limits, and MLflow instrumentation so you can rerun experiments without surprise drift.

### Security & CI Discipline

Dependency upgrades removed historical CVEs, GitHub Actions enforces lint + tests + security scans, and `.env.example` documents every secret toggle (API keys, artifact pushes, MLflow). Recruiters love seeing end-to-end ownership, not just a model notebook.

### A/B Testing for Safe Model Rollouts

Implemented traffic splitting between ensemble and transformer models with hash-based user assignment for consistency. Tracks latency and accuracy metrics per variant, enabling data-driven model selection. Prevents deploying broken models while measuring real-world performance impact.

## üöÄ Run It Locally (Windows PowerShell)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, set `API_KEY`, and point to your datasets/models.
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare the database and demo content:

```powershell
python -m alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head
python scripts/manage.py seed-db --overwrite
```

4. (Optional) Fine-tune or retrain models:

```powershell
# TF-IDF baseline on HuffPost (default dataset with dates)
python scripts/manage.py train-baseline --limit 5000

# HuffPost transformer (dataset already available locally)
python scripts/manage.py train-transformer --data-path data/raw/huffpost/News_Category_Dataset_v3.json
```

5. Launch the API:

```powershell
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

6. (Optional) Bring up the entire stack with Docker:

```powershell

```

## üìä Ops & Tooling Quick Reference

- **Review queue triage**: `python scripts/manage.py active-finetune --dry-run` shows what will feed the next training pass.
- **Bundle deployable artifacts**: `python scripts/manage.py bundle-artifacts --label nightly --push` zips configs + models and pushes to S3-compatible storage when `ARTIFACT_STORE_TYPE=s3`.
- **Security & quality**: `ruff check .`, `bandit -r app scripts dashboard -ll`, `pip-audit`, and `pytest` match the CI pipeline.
- Docs for deeper dives live under `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, and `docs/STREAM_REVIEW.md`.

## üëÄ Demo Dashboard

```powershell
streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py
```

The Streamlit app mirrors real API calls, showcases confidence scores, and surfaces trend charts from `/trends`‚Äîideal for walking a recruiter through the product without hitting the raw JSON endpoints.

### Experience entry (recommended)

News Topic Intelligence Platform ‚Äî ML Engineer (2024‚Äì2025)

- Built a production-ready FastAPI platform for news classification and summarization with 11+ REST endpoints, SQLAlchemy/Alembic, and structured logging/metrics.
- Implemented multimodal news classification using CLIP + BLIP vision models, combining text and image analysis for enhanced accuracy with intelligent confidence scoring.
- Added GPU-accelerated AI image generation using Stable Diffusion 1.5 (RTX 4060 + diffusers), producing 512√ó512 visuals in ~3‚Äì5s via FastAPI and Streamlit UI.
- Delivered A/B testing infrastructure with hash-based user assignment and real-time metrics to compare ensemble vs transformer models for safe rollouts.
- Added active learning loop: routed low-confidence predictions into a review queue and merged human feedback into retraining pipelines.
- Implemented Stream Review system for real-time human-in-the-loop labeling of streaming data, automatically detecting low-confidence predictions and anomalies during live news processing with dedicated review queues and dashboard integration.
- Implemented hybrid time series forecasting with Prophet/XGBoost/LSTM ensemble models for predicting news category trends using 10+ years of historical data.
- Automated ML lifecycle with Typer CLI (train/eval/bundle), GitHub Actions CI (ruff/pytest/bandit), and artifact publishing to S3-compatible storage.
- Shipped an interactive Streamlit dashboard (classification, summarization, trends, forecasting, images) for stakeholder demos and analysis.
